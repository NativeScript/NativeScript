## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [NativeScript Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to <oss@nativescript.org>.

3. **Create a branch** for your changes
4. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
5. **Test your changes** thoroughly
6. **Submit a pull request**

## Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues as you might find that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps
- **Describe the behavior you observed** and what you expected to see
- **Include screenshots or animated GIFs** if relevant

## Requesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Before submitting a feature request:

2. **Clearly describe the feature** and its use case
3. **Explain why this feature would be useful** to most NativeScript users
4. **Provide examples** of how the feature would be used

We prefer feature requests that:

- Describe a need rather than a specific technical solution
- Are applicable to a broad range of users
- Align with the NativeScript project goals

npm start
```

### Project Structure

```

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a strict commit message format to enable automatic changelog generation and make the commit history more readable.

### Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Type

Must be one of:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **build**: Changes to build system or dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Scope

The scope should be the name of the affected component (e.g., `core`, `android`, `ios`, `webpack`).

### Subject

- Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No period (.) at the end
- Keep it concise (50 characters or less)

### Examples

```text
feat(core): add support for dark mode detection

fix(ios): resolve memory leak in ListView component

docs(readme): update installation instructions

perf(android): optimize image loading performance
```

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes should be indicated in the footer:

```text
feat(core): change API signature for module loading

BREAKING CHANGE: 

The `loadModule` function now requires a second parameter
specifying the module type.

Migration:
- Before: loadModule('path/to/module')
- After: loadModule('path/to/module', 'js')
```

## Code Style

- We use Prettier for code formatting
- We use ESLint for code linting
- Run `npm run format` to format your code
- Run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Update JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Add examples for new features
- Keep documentation clear and concise
