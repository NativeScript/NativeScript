# WinterCG compliance for NativeScript

This library represents native code (Objective-C and Java) used by [`@nativescript/core`](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/tree/main/packages/core) to provide [WinterCG](https://wintercg.org/) compliance.

[NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) provides platform APIs directly to the JavaScript runtime (with strong types) for a rich TypeScript development experience.
